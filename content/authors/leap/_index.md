We believe all internet users should have access to secure communications. Encryption technologies need to be easy to use and widely available.

We try to solve hard problems, connecting technologists, researchers and grassroots organizations. As part of this work, we provide tools to build your own VPN infrastructure, and clients to connect to it. Easy. Secure. Beautiful.
